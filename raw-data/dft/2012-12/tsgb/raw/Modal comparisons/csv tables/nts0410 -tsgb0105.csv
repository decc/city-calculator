Note: The results presented in this table are weighted. The base (unweighted sample size) is shown in the table for information. Weights are applied to adjust for non-response to ensure the characteristics of the achieved sample match the population of Great Britain and for the drop off in trip recording. The survey results are subject to sampling error.,,,,,,,,,,,,
