1 Includes purpose built taxis (which are wheelchair accessible) and converted vehicles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2 Information about wheelchair accessible PHVs was collected for the first time in 2011.  Response rates for this question were lower than for other parts of the survey and these figures are estimated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
by scaling those provided by authorities that were able to provide a response.  TfL were unable to provide a figure for London so these totals are likely to represent underestimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
