1. The length of route is that managed by Network Rail (formerly Railtrack).  It does not include track managed by private companies or ,,,,,,,,,,,,
    Passenger Transport Executive services operating on separately managed track.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. Pre-1947 figures refer to track length, not route length, and include electrified sidings.  In 1947 electrified track kilometres totalled 3,370. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Break in series due to a change in methodology (see Notes and Definitions).,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Break in series.  From 1994/95 figures include an element of double counting, as a journey involving more than one train is counted ",,,,,,,,,,,,
    for each train. This contrasts with former British Rail data for which a through ticket journey was counted only once. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Break in series.  From 2009/10 National Rail passenger journeys and passenger kilometres figures include non-franchised train,,,,,,,,,,,,
"    operators. Figures prior to this include franchised operators only. In 2009/10 there were 1,258 million franchised passenger journeys",,,,,,,,,,,,
    and 51.1 billion passenger kilometres.,,,,,,,,,,,,
P. 2011/12 passenger journeys and kilometres are provisional.,,,,,,,,,,,,
