1. UK national emissions estimates are updated annually and any developments in methodology ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sources - AEA Energy & Environment/DECC (NAEI);
    are applied retrospectively to earlier years. The largest revisions in the latest estimates were ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Office for National Statistics (Environmental Accounts)
    for shipping (a reallocation of emissions from domestic to international) and rail (a slight decrease,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    across the series). See notes and definitions for the reasons behind these revisions.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Last updated: November 2012
2. The 'by source' figures for transport only include direct emissions from transport while the 'by final,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Next updated: September 2013
    user' transport figures also include appoximate emissions resulting from the production of the fuels ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"    used, which takes place within the UK (see notes and definitions). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3. 'Other road transport emissions' consist of emissions from road vehicles running on liquified,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    petroleum gas (propane and butane) and emissions from the evaporation of engine lubricants. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. There are no direct emissions from electric trains. However the final user emissions do include the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    emissions resulting from the production of the electricity used by electric trains. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5. Other mainly consists of 'military aircraft and shipping' and 'aircraft support vehicles'. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. International aviation and international shipping emissions are not included in the national total ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"    reported to the UNFCCC, since there is no internationally agreed way of allocating these  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    emissions to individual nation states (see notes and definitions).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. The economic sectors are based on similar concepts and classifications of industries to those  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
    used in the National Accounts (see notes and definitions).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
