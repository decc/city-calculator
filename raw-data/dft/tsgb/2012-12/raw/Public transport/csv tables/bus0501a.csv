"1. Excludes capital receipts, and other streams of bus operator revenue that are not directly related to the provision of local bus services ",,,,,,,,
"(e.g. income from advertising, private hire work, etc.)",,,,,,,,
2. These figures are not adjusted for inflation.,,,,,,,,
"3. Only includes fare receipts retained by bus operators. On some tendered or supported services, fare receipts are passed to the local authority.",,,,,,,,
"4. Public Transport Support is the total of all local authorities' gross costs incurred in support of bus services, either directly or by subsidies to operators or",,,,,,,,
individuals.  The bulk of these costs will be accounted for by payments to operators providing tendered or supported bus services (including non-local services,,,,,,,,
"in some case).  However, the figures also include administration costs and some inter-authority transfers, meaning that a small proportion of the sums shown ",,,,,,,
will not reach bus operators.  In London it will also include depreciation on capital.,,,,,,,
5. Concessionary Travel is the total of all local authorities' net costs of statutory or discretionary concessionary bus travel.,,,,,,,
"Discretionary concessionary travel is decided by local authorites, and can include travel for those that not included within the statutory concession, travel",,,,,,,
"within the peak or travel on other modes. These figures exclude travel on the London Underground, Mersey Ferries and Rail, West Yorkshire PTE Rail, and",,,,,,,
"Light Rail Systems, however they do include funding for taxi tokens.  Table bus0811 shows the total including all discretionary elements excluded here.",,,,,,,
"Although gross local authority costs would normally be the best measure of operators' revenue, net costs have been used in preference to gross costs",,,,,,,
"in this table.  This is because the latter figures include double-counting as a result of substantial inter-authority funding transfers, where one local authority",,,,,,,
"administers a concessionary travel scheme on behalf of several others. The figures include administration costs, meaning that a small proportion of the sums ",,,,,,,
shown will not reach bus operators.,,,,,,,
6. Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG) is a subsidy provided by Central Government to operators of local bus services.,,,,,,,
The distribution of BSOG payments between English Metropolitan areas and English non-Metropolitan areas is an estimate.,,,,,,,
"These figures include payments for the BSOG AVL and smartcard incentives from April 2010, but not the coach concession.",,,,,,,
7. London runs an entirely tendered market and therefore some comparisons with the rest of country should be treated with care. For example concessionary,,,,,,,
"travel is available on other modes than buses. Concessionary Fare Reimbursement in London includes funding from London Councils, received through",,,,,,,
special grant.  The figures are supplied by London Councils and will not necessarily equal RSG Funding plus London Councils' Special Grant.,,,,,,,
"8. Until 2009/10 figures in this table for public transport support, and concessionary travel outside London, were on a Financial Reporting Standard 17 (FRS17)",,,,,,,
basis.  For 2009/10 they are on a non-FRS17 basis. For 2010/11 onwards they are on a non-International Accounting Standard 19 (IAS19) basis.,,,,,,,
"9. The 2009/10 figures contain an additional element of spending, RECS, which for other years is included only in capital charges and therefore excluded",,,,,,,
from current expenditure (as shown here).  This may affect comparisons with previous or following years.,,,,,,,
R Minor revisions have been made to earlier years data.,,,,,,,
"P We are expecting a revision to the 2011/12 “public transport support” figure in one metropolitan transport authority. The revised figure is not yet available so,",,,,,,,
"as an interim step, we have used  an estimate for this authority based on published budget data.",,,,,,,
