1 Break in the local bus series (outside London) due to changes in the estimation methodology from 2004/05,,,,,,,,,,,
"2 Buses in London operate under a different regulatory model to the rest of the country, and comparisons on a service type basis would",,,,,,,,,,,
have little meaning. London figures are therefore excluded from this table.,,,,,,,,,,,
R Previously published figures have been revised.  For details of the revisions (which include planned updates) please see the technical information,,,,,,,,,,,
