"Simple unit"
-------------

A simple unit is a single symbol that uniquely identifies a
dimension. 

Definitions vs. Physics
-----------------------

Hypothesis: Some combinations of quantity spaces are definitional, some are
physics. So for example: 


Definitional:	[area] = [length]^2 
 
		[acceleration] = [velocity] [time]^-1

		?? [frequency] = [time]^-1

		?? [solid angle] = [angle]^2

(Tensor product spaces; only one defintion).


Physics:	[energy] = [force] [distance]

		[force] = [mass] [acceleration] 

(Grouping matters; multiple isomporphisms).

So ... what's [torque]? The problem is, it's definitional, but I wouldn't name
[force]x[distance] as [torque]. Is *everything* an isomorphism? So, for example,
[area] ~ [length]x[length] ? 

 Well ... why not?


dim([X]) is a vector, s.t. dim([X][Y]) = dim([X])+dim([Y]). 


Reduced form
------------

Units in reduced form are powers of basis units. Dimensions in reduced form
are powers of basis dimensions.


Are dimensions and units equivalent? 
------------------------------------

The map between simple units and dimensions is 1:1 but not onto. A simple unit
implies a dimension; but some dimensions do not have "natural" units. Dimensions
lacking natural units are conventionally measured in equivalent units.

So, for example, torque does not have its own unit. It is measured in N
m. Energy, which is equivalent to N m, does have its own unit, the joule.

The full form of the unit of torque is (N m)_[torque]. This is perhaps not
helpful.


Powers and synonyms
-------------------

[length]^2 is a synonym for [area]. It means [area], rather than [length]
[length]. [length]^-1 is a synonym for [inverse_length]. Likewise, m^3, in the
context of simple units, is a synonym for "cubic metres", the unit of
volume. The unit of [length] [length] [length] is m m m. 



  



An imagined dialogue with R
===========================

add.quantity_kind("energy")

add.unit(quantity_kind = "[energy]", symbol = "J", name = c("joule", "joules"), coherent =
TRUE, system = "SI", allow.prefix = TRUE)

add.unit(quantity_kind = "[energy]", symbol = "toe", name = c("tonne of oil
equivalent", "tonnes of oil equivalent"), coherent = FALSE, allow.prefix = TRUE)

add.conversion(defiendum = "toe", value = as.quantity(4.1868e10, unit = "J"))

add.morphism("[acceleration]", "[length] [time]^-1 [time]^-1")
add.morphism("[force]", "[mass] [acceleration]") 
add.morphism("[energy]", "[force] [distance]")
add.morphism("[torque]", "[force] [distance]")
add.morphism("[angle]", "[UNIT]")
add.morphism("[energy]", "[torque] [angle]")

add.unit.series(quantity_kind = "time", series = "hms", c("y", "d", "h", "min",
"sec"), ..., coherent = FALSE)







### Some notes on units
### 

### Nomenclature:

Dimensions
---------- 

[force], [length], [time], [energy], [mass], [velocity] ...

[energy] = [mass] [length]^2 [time]^-2

[force] = [mass] [length] [time]^-2

[velocity] = [length] [time]^-1

- spaces are not required in multiplying dimensions.
- brackets are required.
- lower case, english words, although perhaps we should use [M] [L] [T] for the
  usual basis ones, and [energy], [force], etc for the usual derived ones.

? "_" not spaces

There is a distinction between a "dimension qua dimension" (eg, [force]) and a
"dimension expressed in a basis" (eg, [mass] [length] [time]^-2)

Units
-----

Each base dimension has a set of units.
Derived dimensions may have individual units, or derived units (derived from the
definition).

Units([mass]) ={kg, g, slug, ...}
Units([length]) = {m, cm, ft, furlong, ...}
Units([energy]) = {J, W h, toe, ...}
Units([force]) = {N, lb, ...}

Base units
----------

How things should be written when not using powers. May include powers. (Not
sure how to deal with this yet!)

{m, kg, s} or {cm, g, s} for example

Some units don't take prefixes. 

- 1000 lb, not 1 Glb

But some units of the same dimension come in "compatible" groups:

{kg, tonne}, {s, min, h, day, yr, ...}, {inch, foot, yard, mile, ...)

tonne = Mg, but treat as different unit.

Basis units may not be the same as basis dimensions. For example, one may wish to
measure in [energy] and use kW h, rather than J.


Restrictions
------------

- Only integer powers. Implication: Only certain sets of basis vectors are allowed.

MLT -> E, F, T

[length] = [energy] [force]^-1
[mass] = [force] [length]^-1 [time]^2 = [force] [energy]^-1 [force] [time]^2
       = [energy]^-1 [force]^2 [time]^2
[time] = [time]

 
Hmm..

[power] = [energy] [time]^-1

so MLT -> F, E, P?

[time] = [power]^-1 [energy]


Kind-of-quantity
----------------

Right. So, the International Vocabulary of Metrology notes that quantities can
have the same dimension, but not be of the same kind. (Which I guess is what we
are trying to express by the above.)

For example: "energy" and "moment of force". Both have dimensions [force]
[length], but they are not the same "kind-of-quantity".


More trouble
------------

radian (a unit of [angle]) has base dimension 1. How do we know to denote
numbers of dimension 1 "rad" and not, as it might be, "Âµg / kg"?


How about the following:

1. A dimension is a vector in D. Certain vectors have names. (eg, [energy],
[velocity]). Certain named vectors have units (eg, [energy], but not [velocity]
in SI; although "mach" and "knot" in other units.).

? "mach" ~ "knot" ~ "km/h"

2. A kind-of-quantity K is a set, {v1, v2, ..., vn}, of vectors in D. Or is a
kind-of-quantity set a set of kinds-of-quantities? Er .... 

3. The dimension of K is the vector v1 + v2 + ... + vn.

4. There are certain bases which are "physically coherent". (MLT, FEP). One
typically reduces in the appropriate physically coherent basis.

5. Each vector in D (or in a kind-of-quantity set) has a unit. Including the 0
vector, which could have units, eg, 1, %, m/m, rad, ... 



A "set of vectors" is a tensor product space. (But not symmetric. Unless perhaps
it's just products of R with itself?) A kind-of-quantity is a vector space, and
an isomorphism onto a tensor product of other vector spaces. 

A quantity is written by giving -
  (a) a unit for each of some kind-of-quantity spaces;
  (b) a particular isomorphism for this particular quantity's kind-of-quantity
  space onto a tensor product of spaces with units.

So ... how do we write an isomorphism?

So ... m s^-1 is a single unit? For velocity, of course: it is that unit of
velocity consistent with the SI units for length and time.

So ... a quantity is a vector in a vector space (sui generis!) and an
isomorphism from that vector space onto a distinguished tensor product space
(which defines the dimension). Then, for each tensor product space, there are a
set of named units -- each unit is a single name. Some of them, true, *look
like* products of more fundamental units. But this is just a helpful similarity
of surface features.

Okay. 

[length] for dimension.
{m s^-1} for a single unit  for this dimension (in this case, in [velocity]).   
<X> for a  

Is there a unique derived unit for each dimension? No. 

Units apply to quantity-kinds. rad is the unit of [angle]. [angle] is a quantity
kind. It is isomorphic to [length] [length]^-1 (tensor product implied).

units can be derived as the pull-back of other units via the isomorphism. 

s^-1 is a different unit to s.

What is the structure on the space of all quantity-kinds? What if we thought
"kinetic energy" and "potential energy" were two different quantity-kinds? How
do we arrange that both are measured in J? Would there be J_kinetic and
J_potential? I guess so ... both would be pull-backs of kg m^2 s^-2?
